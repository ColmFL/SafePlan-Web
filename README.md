# SafePlan-Web
A MERN stack web application which pulls data from a database and renders it to the client using dynamic graphs. The application could be used to track patient data by use of the graphs. The system utilises Rest APIâ€™s to transfer data from the server side to the client side. Authentication is a central feature as security is paramount. MERN: MongoDB, Express JS, React, and Node JS.
