# SafePlan-Web
A MERN stack web application which pulls data from a database and renders it to the client using dynamic graphs. The application could be used to track patient data by use of the graphs. Graphs can track changes in mood or other mental health indicators as input by a patient. 

The system utilises Rest APIâ€™s to transfer data from the server side to the client side. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.

Authentication is a central feature as security is paramount. The user credentials are stored on another MongoDB database and compared against user input at the login screen.

MERN: MongoDB, Express JS, React, and Node JS.
